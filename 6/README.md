In the terminal type : locate cgi-bin

Select the first path and move to that directory

In the folder create a new perl script type : sudo gedit 6.pl

sudo is required because you don't have root permissions to access cgi directory

key in the password

Type the code or copy it and paste!

Don't forget to type : sudo chmod 777 6.pl

save it and open the browser : localhost/cgi-bin/6.pl on the browser

Cheers!
