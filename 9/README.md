Even though this file is a html file, it has to be .php when you save it
These type of php files should be stored in the /var/www as a separate file (like 9.php)
Start the tag as <?php while coding in php and not <?
Then run it on your browser as localhost/9.php
You cannot run it on a normal folder as .html, if you save it as .php and try to run it you'll be asked to download it
In windows start a wamp server and then run this .php file
