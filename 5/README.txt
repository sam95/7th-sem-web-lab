ENV is stored as a Hashed array, so we are accessing the value using keys
html file is not required! there are no inputs so only perl script is sufficient!
In the terminal type : locate cgi-bin
Select the first path and move to that directory
In the folder create a new perl script type : sudo gedit 5a.pl
sudo is required because you don't have root permissions to access cgi directory
key in the password
Type the code or copy it and paste!
Don't forget to type : sudo chmod 777 5a.pl
save it and open the browser : localhost/cgi-bin/5a.pl on the browser
Cheers!
